## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, we strongly encourage responsible disclosure and offer the following reporting process:

### üîí Private Disclosure Process

- **Preferred Method:** Use [GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting](../../security/advisories) feature.
- **Alternative:** Send encrypted email to `security@yourdomain.com` using our [PGP key](https://yourdomain.com/pgp.txt).

Please include the following in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability and potential impact
- Affected versions
- Steps to reproduce
- Proof-of-concept code or exploit (if applicable)
- Your contact information for follow-up

We will respond within **72 hours** with:
- Acknowledgment of the report
- A triage plan and severity assessment (see CVSS rating below)
- Disclosure and remediation timeline (if applicable)

## Vulnerability Management Process

1. **Triage:** The issue is validated and assessed for impact and scope.
2. **Severity Rating:** We assign a CVSSv3 base score to determine priority:
   - üî¥ Critical (9.0‚Äì10.0)
   - üü† High (7.0‚Äì8.9)
   - üü° Medium (4.0‚Äì6.9)
   - üü¢ Low (0.1‚Äì3.9)
3. **Remediation:** A patch is developed and tested internally.
4. **Disclosure Coordination:** With the reporter, a coordinated release is scheduled.
5. **Public Advisory:** Once the fix is published, a GitHub Security Advisory is released.

## Coordinated Disclosure Policy

We follow industry-standard [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)](https://www.cisa.gov/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-process) guidelines:

- We prefer **non-public disclosure first** to allow time for patch development.
- We aim to resolve critical issues within **30 days**, medium within **90 days**.
- Credit will be given to responsible reporters in advisory releases unless anonymity is requested.

## Security Enhancements & Best Practices

We maintain a proactive security posture, including:
- GitHub Advanced Security (secret scanning, Dependabot alerts)
- Static and dynamic analysis in CI/CD
- SBOM generation and signing (SPDX/CycloneDX)
- Regular third-party audits (where applicable)
